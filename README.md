# ELK Stack

1. elk-security-setup.sh - The "Office Building"



What it does: This builds the entire ELK office building with three departments.

Simple Explanation:

Elasticsearch = The Library (stores all the data)

Logstash = The Editor's Desk (processes and formats data)

Kibana = The Newsroom Display (shows beautiful charts)

Key Parts:

Creates docker-compose-elk.yml (blueprint for the building)

Downloads and starts all three services

Makes them connect to each other

sleep 30 = "Wait for the building to be ready for visitors"







2. inject-security-data.sh - The "News Reporter"



What it does: This sends your first sample security data to Elasticsearch.

Simple Explanation:

It's like a reporter sending the first news article to the library

Creates a JSON "news article" about your system security:






3. collect-metrics.sh - The "Regular Beat Reporter"



What it does: This constantly collects and sends security data every 30 seconds.

Simple Explanation:

while true; do = "Keep doing this forever"

Every 30 seconds, it checks:

    Network connections

    Open ports

    Running containers

    ARP table entries

Packages this as a "news update" and sends to Logstash






How ELK Stack Works Together


Think of it like a newspaper workflow:

Reporter (collect-metrics.sh) → Gathers facts

Editor (Logstash) → Formats and cleans the facts

#Grafana



1. grafana-security-setup.sh - The "Kitchen Setup"



Simple Explanation:

It creates a docker-compose-grafana.yml file (like a furniture assembly manual)

Starts Grafana (dashboard) and Loki (data storage) as separate containers

Makes them talk to each other

Waits 30 seconds for everything to start properly

Key Parts:

docker-compose up -d = "Start these services in the background"

sleep 30 = "Wait 30 seconds for everything to warm up"






2. send-security-metrics.sh - The "Data Chef"



What it does: This script collects your computer's security data and sends it to Loki every 30 seconds.

Simple Explanation:

It's like a chef who checks your kitchen every 30 seconds:

   Counts network connections (netstat -an)

   Checks open ports (ss -tuln)

   Counts running containers (docker ps)

   Checks ARP table (arp -n)

Then it packages this data as JSON and sends it to Loki

Key Parts:

for i in {1..10} = "Do this 10 times"

sleep 30 = "Wait 30 seconds between checks"

curl -X POST = "Send this data to Loki"






3. import-dashboard.sh - The "Display Designer"



What it does: This creates the actual dashboard with 4 panels showing your security metrics.

Simple Explanation:

It creates a pre-designed dashboard layout with:

Panel 1: IP Connections counter

Panel 2: Open Ports counter

Panel 3: Running Containers counter

Panel 4: ARP Entries counter

Uses curl to tell Grafana: "Hey, create this dashboard for me!"





Library (Elasticsearch) → Stores all the news articles

Display (Kibana) → Shows beautiful charts and dashboards
